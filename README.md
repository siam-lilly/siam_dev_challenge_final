# Javascript Challenge 


## Introduction

This takehome task was developed in order to test the basic skillset of a JavaScript developer.

The task consists of backend and frontend functionalities.

You are free to use the internet but must solve this task yourself.

## How to use

Install Git and Node.JS on your system.

Verify that the above software has been downloaded correctly by executing the following commands in a terminal:

`git -v`\
`node -v`\
`npm -v`

The above commands should print a version number in the console.


Create a repo in your GitHub account (do not fork via GitHub!).

Then clone the contents of this repo into it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tpage-lilly/Javascript-Dev-Challenge
cd JavaScript-Challenge-master
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_github_account/your-repo.git
git push -u origin
```

Install backend dependencies with the command `npm install`.

NOTE: If you are on the Lilly network please make sure you have run the following commands in the terminal.
```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://foo:bar@proxy.gtm.lilly.com:9000 
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://foo:bar@proxy.gtm.lilly.com:9000
```
 
Run the backend service and serve static files with the command `npm run start`.

You can now begin development. To view and test the changes you have made, save the file and restart the local server by executing `npm run start` again (alternatively, install the ‘Live Server’ VS Code extension, or a similar extension if you are using another IDE, and you can view your changes in realtime).

Once complete share your GitHub repo URL.

## The application

The goal of the application is to display how stock prices change over time.

In this starter template you get:
* A backend application written in `node.js` that serves information about stocks (for the last 10 hours).
* A frontend template that renders an empty chart and static spinner.

Getting stock data has a **10% chance of failure** (by design). The application needs to account for that.

## Mission objectives

* Make the spinner rotate using CSS3 - Please write custom CSS.
* Query the backend for list of available stocks.
* Query the backend for data about each stock.
* Hide the spinner after all data is loaded.
* Log to the console the result stock data in a structured way.
* Fix backend (app.js) to return a meaningful error message when stock data cannot be retrieved (now the request just hangs!).

Additional (if you have time)
* Plot the stock data on the chart (as a line chart).

## Constraints
* You are **not** to modify the code in `stocks.js`
* The stocks API is designed to return errors sometimes. The application should gain the ability to cope with that.
* You can use the provided mini-API for canvas operations, but you can also use other solution.
